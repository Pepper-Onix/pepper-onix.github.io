### SOLUTION

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command. (The “pwd” command can be used to view the current working directory). 

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```
We see there is an file named `readme` to view the contents of this file we can use the `cat` command.

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme

We have found the password for the next level !!
