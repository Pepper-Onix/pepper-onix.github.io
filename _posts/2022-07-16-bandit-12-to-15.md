## Level 12 to Level 13

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED


> grep             - print lines that match patterns

> sort             - sort lines of text files

> uniq             - report or omit repeated lines

> strings          - print the sequences of printable characters in files

> base64           - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output

> tr               - translate or delete characters

> tar              - an archiving utility

> gzip             - compress or expand files

> bzip2            - a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.8

> xxd              - make a hexdump or do the reverse.

> mkdir            - make directories

> cp               - copy files and directories

> mv               - move (rename) files

> file             - determine file type

### SOLUTION

View the contents of the working directory.

```bash
bandit12@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
```
Check out the data of `data.txt` with `head`.

```bash
bandit12@bandit:~$ head data.txt
00000000: 1f8b 0808 0650 b45e 0203 6461 7461 322e  .....P.^..data2.

```
In order to work easily we copy the file to a local file `data.hex`. Since it is an hexdump file we have to reverse it with `xxd` and check out the compression type.

```bash
$ xxd -r data.hex > data | file data
data: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 573
```
So it is a gzip compressed file. We rename it correctly and we decompress the file with `7z`. ( I know this command is not listed at level's statement but it's the easiest and universal one.)

```bash
$ mv data data.gzip
$ 7z x data.gzip
Scanning the drive for archives:
1 file, 606 bytes (1 KiB)

Extracting archive: data.gzip
--
Path = data.gzip
Type = gzip
Headers Size = 20

Everything is Ok

Size:       573
Compressed: 606

```
It returns a new file called `data2.bin`. We check the file info and we repeat the process of decompression recursively.

```bash
$ file data2.bin
data2.bin: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
$ mv data2.bin data.bzip2
$ 7z x data2.bzip2
Scanning the drive for archives:
1 file, 573 bytes (1 KiB)

Extracting archive: data2.bzip2
--
Path = data2.bzip2
Type = bzip2

Everything is Ok

Size:       431
Compressed: 573
```
It returns a file called data2. And we repeat the process.

```bash
$ file data2
data2: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Thu May  7 18:14:30 2020, max compression, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 20480
$ mv data2 data2.gzip
$ 7z x data2.gzip
Scanning the drive for archives:
1 file, 431 bytes (1 KiB)

Extracting archive: data2.gzip
--
Path = data2
Type = gzip
Headers Size = 20

Everything is Ok

Size:       20480
Compressed: 431
```
We keep decompressing with `7z x` until we get an ASCII file called `data9.bin`. We print the content of the file.

```bash
$ cat data9.bin
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL
```
And we got the password... but we could automate the process of decompressing all files. I copy the script below.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

name_decompressed=$(7z l data | grep "Name" -A 2 | tail -n 1 | awk 'NF{print $NF}')
7z x data > /dev/null 2>&1


while true; do
        7z l $name_decompressed > /dev/null 2>&1

        if [ $? -eq "0" ];then
                decompressed_next=$(7z l $name_decompressed | grep "Name" -A 2 | tail -n 1 | awk 'NF{print $NF}')
                7z x $name_decompressed > /dev/null 2>&1 && name_decompressed=$decompressed_next
        else
                cat $name_decompressed
                exit 1
        fi
done

```
## Level 13 to Level 14

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

> The password for the next level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED

> Same commands as level 12.

### SOLUTION

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command.

```bash
$ ls
inhere
sshkey.private
```
We have an SSH private key. We can use the SSH command with the `-i` flag to use the private key.

```bash
$ ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost

```
We just logged in as bandit14 user, so now we can read the password at `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`

```bash
$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e
```
We have found the password for the next level!

## Level 14 to Level 15

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

> The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.
