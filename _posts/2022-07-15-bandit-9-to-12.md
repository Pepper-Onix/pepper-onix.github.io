## Level 9 to Level 10

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

>*The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.*

### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED

> *grep   - print lines that match patterns*

> *sort   - sort lines of text files*

> *uniq   - report or omit repeated lines*

> *strings- print the sequence of printable characters in files*

> *base64 - print the sequence of printable characters in files*

> *tr     - translate or delete characters*

> *tar    - an archiving utility*

> *gzip   - compress or expand files*

> *bzip2  - a block-sorting file compressor*

> *xxd    - make a hexdump or do the reverse*
### SOLUTION

View the contents of the current working directory.

```bash
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
```
Check out the data that is present in the file. This can be achieved using `head` command.

```bash
bandit9@bandit:~$ head -n 4 data.txt
�L�lω;��ßOܛ��ǤX��NdT$��x7��@D@�o��+D��B��M֢�Z/,_��w��#�5���
                                                              Ў�e�&�-��Ϣ�6Q8��J�%fa�

```
Human readable string in a file can be found using the `strings` command.
The `-e` flag is used to specify the character encoding. We are assuming the human readable line is ASCII so we use "s" for the encoding type.

We also know that the line with the password starts with a few "=" characters. We can look for this pattern in the file using the `grep` command. We can combine all these commands into a single line using the pipe operator.

```bash
bandit9@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | strings -e s | grep ==
========== the*2i"4
========== password
Z)========== is
&========== truKLdjsbJ5g7yyJ2X2R0o3a5HQJFuLk
```

We have found the password for the next level!


## Level 10 to Level 11

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

> The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.

### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED

> Same commands as level 10.

### SOLUTION

View the contents of the current working directory.

```bash
bandit10@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
```
Check out the data that is in the file.

```bash
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
VGhlIHBhc3N3b3JkIGlzIElGdWt3S0dzRlc4TU9xM0lSRnFyeEUxaHhUTkViVVBSCg==
```
Looking at the content it looks like an string of random characters but from the question we know that the data is base64 encoded. We can decode this data using the base64 command that is present on unix systems. The `-d` flag is used to decode the data.

```bash
bandit10@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | base64 -d
The password is IFukwKGsFW8MOq3IRFqrxE1hxTNEbUPR
```
We have found the password for the next level!

## Level 11 to Level 12

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

> *The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.*


### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED

> *Same commands as level 10.*

## SOLUTION

View the contents of the current working directory.

```bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
```
Check out the data that is present in the file.

```bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
Gur cnffjbeq vf 5Gr8L4qetPEsPk8htqjhRK8XSP6x2RHh
```
We know that the characters in the data are rotated by 13 characters. We can get the characters to its original order using the tr command. The tr command is used to translate/ transform data from one form to another.

```bash
bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
The password is 5Te8Y4drgCRfCx8ugdwuEX8KFC6k2EUu
```
We have found the password for the next level!
