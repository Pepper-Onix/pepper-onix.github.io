## Level 15 to Level 16

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

>**

### COMMANDS

> *ls     - list directory contents.*

> *cd     - change working directory.*

> *cat    - concatenate files and print on the standard output.*

> *file   - determine file type.*

> *du     - estimate file space usage.*

> *find   - search for files in a directory hierarchy.*

### SOLUTION

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command.

```bash
bandit3@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
```
Move into the `inhere/` directory. This can be done using the `cd` command

```bash
bandit3@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
```
View files that are in the directory using the `ls` command. Since we know the file is hidden we have to use the `-a` flag to view hidden files.

```bash
bandit3@bandit:~/inhere$ ls -a
.
..
.hidden
```
View the content of `.hidden` file using the `cat` command.

> *find   - search for files in a directory hierarchy.*

### SOLUTION

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command. Next move into the `inhere/` directory. This can be done using the `cd` command. 

```bash
bandit4@bandit:~$ ls
inhere

bandit4@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
```
View files that are in the directory using the `ls` command.

```bash
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
-file00  -file01  -file02  -file03  -file04  -file05  -file06  -file07  -file08  -file09
```
We know we have to find file who’s content is in Human Readable format. This check can be performed using the `file` command. File command returns the type of data that is found in the file. 

```bash
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ file ./*
./-file00: data
./-file01: data
./-file02: data
./-file03: data
./-file04: data
./-file05: data
./-file06: data
./-file07: ASCII text
./-file08: data
./-file09: data
```
View the content of `-file07` file using the `cat` command.

```bash
bandit4@bandit:~/inhere$ cat ./-file07

> *find   - search for files in a directory hierarchy.*

## SOLUTION

View files that are in the `inhere` directory.

```bash
bandit5@bandit:~$ ls
inhere
bandit5@bandit:~$ cd inhere/
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ ls
maybehere00  maybehere03  maybehere06  maybehere09  maybehere12  maybehere15  maybehere18
maybehere01  maybehere04  maybehere07  maybehere10  maybehere13  maybehere16  maybehere19
maybehere02  maybehere05  maybehere08  maybehere11  maybehere14  maybehere17

```

To search for the file that we require using the properties that are specified in the question we can make use of the `find` command.

```bash
bandit5@bandit:~/inhere$ find . -type f -size 1033c -not -executable -exec file {} + | grep ASCII
./maybehere07/.file2: ASCII text, with very long lines
```
> ### Command Explanation
> - . : Search the current working directory only
> - -type f : Look for files only (Exclude Directories)
> - -size 1033c : Look for files that are exactly 1033 bytes in size (Find uses “c” to represent bytes)
> - -not -executable : Find only non executable files
> - -exec file {} + : Execute the file command on all the results returns by find
>
> **NOTE:** {} is an placeholder for the location where the names of the files found by find is going to be substituted. The “+” sign is used to terminate the statemen. 

From the previous level we know that file command will return value “ASCII Text” for human readable files. So by using grep we are filtering the output to only show results with that contain that string. 
The pipe (|) operator is used to pass the output of one command as the input of another command. 
Finally we print the content of the file.

```bash
cat ./maybehere07/.file2
