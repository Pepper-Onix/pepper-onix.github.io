## Level 0 to Level 1

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT
>*The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.*

### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED

> *ls     - list directory contents.*
                                                                                                                        
> *cd     - change working directory.*
                                                                                                                                                                           >
> *cat    - concatenate files and print on the standard output.*
                                                                                                                       
> *file   - determine file type.*
                                                                                                                        
> *du     - estimate file space usage.*
                                                                                                                        
> *find   - search for files in a directory hierarchy.*

### SOLUTION

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command. (The “pwd” command can be used to view the current working directory). 

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ ls
readme
```
We see there is a file named `readme` to view the contents of this file we can use the `cat` command.

```bash
bandit0@bandit:~$ cat readme 
boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1
```
We have found the password for the next level !!

## Level 1 to Level 2

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

>*The password for the next level is stored in a file called `—` located in the home directory*


### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED

> *ls     - list directory contents.*
                                                                                                                        
> *cd     - change working directory.*
                                                                                                                                                                           >
> *cat    - concatenate files and print on the standard output.*
                                                                                                                       
> *file   - determine file type.*
                                                                                                                        
> *du     - estimate file space usage.*
                                                                                                                        
> *find   - search for files in a directory hierarchy.*

### SOLUTION

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command. 

```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ ls
-
```
We can view the content of file named `-` using the `cat` command. **NOTE:** `-` in Linux refers to Standard Input/ Standard Output (STDIN/ STDOUT). So We have to use the concept of redirection or specify the absolute path to the file to access it.
```bash
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat < -
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
bandit1@bandit:~$ cat ./-
CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9
```
We have found the password for the next level !


## Level 2 to Level 3

## The Level's statement

>*The password for the next level is stored in a file called `spaces in this filename` located in the home directory.*


### COMMANDS YOU MAY NEED

> *ls     - list directory contents.*
                                                                                                                        
> *cd     - change working directory.*
                                                                                                                                                                           >
> *cat    - concatenate files and print on the standard output.*
                                                                                                                       
> *file   - determine file type.*
                                                                                                                        
> *du     - estimate file space usage.*
                                                                                                                        
> *find   - search for files in a directory hierarchy.*

## SOLUTION

View the files that are present in the current working directory using the `ls` command. 

```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
```
View the content of the file named spaces in this filename using the cat command. **NOTE:** The spaces in the name can be escaped using \ , another approach is to enclosing the filename in "" (quotes).

```bash
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
bandit2@bandit:~$ cat "spaces in this filename"
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
```
We have found the password for the next level !
