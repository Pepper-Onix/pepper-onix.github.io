## Level 6 to Level 7

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

>*The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:*
>
> *- owned by user bandit7*
> *- owned by group bandit6*
> *- 33 bytes in size*

### COMMANDS

> *ls     - list directory contents.*
                                                                                                                        
> *cd     - change working directory.*
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
> *cat    - concatenate files and print on the standard output.*
                                                                                                                       
> *file   - determine file type.*
                                                                                                                        
> *du     - estimate file space usage.*
                                                                                                                        
> *find   - search for files in a directory hierarchy.*

### SOLUTION

Since we don't know where the file is we will have to search the entire server. We know some properties about the file that we can use to try and locate the file. Similar to the previous level we can use the `find` command for this task. 

```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
```
> ### Command explanation
> 
> - / : Search the entire server (/ is the root directory on Linux similar to the C:/ Drive on Windows)
> - -type f : Search only for files (Exclude Directories)
> - -user bandit7 : Search for files which are owned by user bandit7
> - -group bandit6 : Search for files that belongs to the group bandit6
> - -size 33c : Look for files that are exactly 33 bytes in size (Find uses “c” to represent size in bytes)

This command alone is sufficient to get the result that we are looking for but since we are scanning the entire server we are going to encounter files what we do not have permission to access and which are going to show errors. 

```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c
find: ‘/root’: Permission denied
find: ‘/home/bandit28-git’: Permission denied
find: ‘/home/bandit30-git’: Permission denied
find: ‘/home/bandit5/inhere’: Permission denied
find: ‘/home/bandit27-git’: Permission denied
find: ‘/home/bandit29-git’: Permission denied
find: ‘/home/bandit31-git’: Permission denied
find: ‘/lost+found’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/ssl/private’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/polkit-1/localauthority’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/lvm/archive’: Permission denied
find: ‘/etc/lvm/backup’: Permission denied
find: ‘/sys/fs/pstore’: Permission denied
```
These errors can be filtered out by sending the error stream (denoted by number 2) to `/dev/null`. NULL is a special device on Linux which destroys all the data that is send to it.

```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2> /dev/null
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
```
We only get one file, so let's view its content.

```bash
bandit6@bandit:~$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
```
Here we get the password.

## Level 7 to Level 8

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

> *The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth. *

### COMMANDS

>*grep             - print lines that match patterns.*

>*sort             - sort lines of text files.*

>*uniq             - report or omit repeated lines.*

>*strings          - print the sequences of printable characters in files.*

>*base64           - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output.*

>*tr               - translate or delete characters.*

>*tar              - an archiving utility.*

>*gzip             - compress or expand files.*

>*bzip2            - a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.8.*

>*xxd              - make a hexdump or do the reverse.*

### SOLUTION

Peek at the data that is present in the file. This can be achieved using the `head` command. 

```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ head -n 10 data.txt 
binning WnfnFPqkuhl2nwHBohzn2C4L5W0gwcLq
abuts v8PAwDdkGDdp5NsJ7ZFM5A7TJ5MkYDbm

```
(The -n flag allows us to specify how many lines to print from start of the file. We can use the `tail` command to look at the last n lines of a file).

We know the password is next to the word “millionth” in the file. We can look for this pattern by using the `grep` command.

```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ grep millionth data.txt 
millionth cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV
```

## Level 8 to Level 9

### THE LEVEL'S STATEMENT

>*The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once.*

### COMMANDS

>*grep             - print lines that match patterns.*

>*sort             - sort lines of text files.*

>*uniq             - report or omit repeated lines.*

>*strings          - print the sequences of printable characters in files.*

>*base64           - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output.*

>*tr               - translate or delete characters.*

>*tar              - an archiving utility.*

>*gzip             - compress or expand files.*

>*bzip2            - a block-sorting file compressor, v1.0.8.*

>*xxd              - make a hexdump or do the reverse.*


## SOLUTION

Peek at the data that is present in the file. This can be achieved using the `head`.

Since we know there are repeating lines in the file, we can use `uniq` with the `-u` flag to print the unique line. Uniq command expects the repeating (similar) lines to be next to each other (adjacent) so we need to sort our data before we can find the unique line.

For sorting we can use `sort` which will sort the data in the file line wise. Finally we can combine all these commands together into an one liner using the `|` (pipe) operator. 

```bash
bandit8@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | sort | uniq -u

```
